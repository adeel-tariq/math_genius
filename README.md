This app is simple math problems game i made for learning purpose.
Not much complex and no network or persistent storage etc used plain simple math problems.

This app is not very screen responsive by which i mean it wont look uniform on different devices
e.g pixel 4 emulator and iphone 14 pro max emulator, nexus 7 tablet emulator, ipad 12.9 inches

So i want this app to look consistent on any screen size, so use any means you deem necessary to make it responsive on all devices, just don't change any logic and work only on UI.
